      text: |-
        I'm an international student from Hong Kong, passionate about learning and growing. I graduated from high school in 2020 and worked a bunch of different jobs to save up for my dream of studying in Australia. I started my journey at Swinburne University with a scholarship, but after a year and a half, I transferred to Monash University for more opportunities and to challenge myself. 

        Along the way, Iâ€™ve learned a lotâ€”working in food services and office jobs taught me how to adapt, work hard, and collaborate with others. These experiences shaped who I am today and inspire me in both my studies and side projects.
